Text preprocessing is a crucial step in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that prepares raw text data for analysis and modeling. It involves cleaning and transforming text into a format suitable for machine learning algorithms or other NLP tasks. Here are the key steps in text preprocessing:
Lowercasing:
Tokenization:
Removing Punctuation:
Removing Stopwords:
Stemming or Lemmatization:
Removing Numbers:
Handling Special Characters:
Text Normalization:
Whitespace Removal:
Text Vectorization:
By applying these preprocessing steps, the raw text is transformed into a structured and machine-readable format, making it ready for NLP tasks such as classification, sentiment analysis, or language modeling.
